# Modular - A theme made for Vesktop
This is one of the first themes that is made exclusively for **Vencord's own client, Vesktop**. It incorporates many of the things I have learned since I started learning about CSS (and modifying Discord clients) in April this year. 

Consider this as my "baby", my first "finished" product that I can contribute to the playground of Discord client mods.

***You heard that right. This theme is only guaranteed to work as expected in Vesktop.***

## Features
- High customizability:
  + ***Add a pre-made Nitro theme or background of your choice*** and adjust the brightness, blur as well as transparency
  + **Client global accent** using the HSL scheme
  + A **second accent color** to highlight important elements and add style
  + **Modules** (user panel, member list, guild list etc.) that can be flipped around
  + Adjustable **chat bubble, status and staff tags colors**
  + Adjustable **primary and code font**
  + **Add a custom name on the titlebar** to make the layout more personal
    
- **A revamped look** for many elements, including profile panels and modals, Spotify controls, guild list and many more!
- **Compatibility and quality of life changes** for many of Vesktop's existing plugins
- Several ***add-ons*** (Settings Icons by [Saltssaumure](https://github.com/Saltssaumure) and Radial Status by [coolesding](https://github.com/coolesding) for now) are available separately in the `modular.theme.css` file
- Active support (to my ability)
- Some of the elements of this theme are available separately as snippets. Check them out [here](https://github.com/SEELE1306/SEELE1306.github.io/tree/main/Snippets).
